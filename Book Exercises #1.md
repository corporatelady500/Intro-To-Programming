You will be working through the exercises at the end of chapter two. 

# Project #

## Complete TWO of the following exercises: ##

1. Modify the avg2.py program (Section 2.5.3) to find the average of three
exam scores.
2. Modify the convert.py program (Section 2.2) with a loop so that it executes
5 times before quitting. Each time through the loop, the program
should get another temperature from the user and print the converted
value.
3. Modify the convert.py program (Section 2.2) so that it computes and
prints a table of Celsius temperatures and the Fahrenheit equivalents every
10 degrees from 0°C to 100°C.

## Complete ONE of the following exercises: ##

1. Modify the futval.py program (Section 2. 7) so that the number of years
for the investment is also a user input. Make sure to change the final
message to reflect the correct number of years.
2. Suppose you have an investment plan where you invest a certain fixed
amount every year. Modify futval.py to compute the total accumulation
of your investment. The inputs to the program will be the amount to invest
each year, the interest rate, and the number of years for the investment.
3. As an alternative to APR, the interest accrued on an account is often described
in terms of a nominal rate and the number of compounding periods.
For example, if the interest rate is 3% and the interest is compounded
quarterly, the account actually earns 3/4% interest every 3 months.
Modify the futval.py program to use this method of entering the
interest rate. The program should prompt the user for the yearly rate
(rate) and the number of times that the interest is compounded each year
(periods). To compute the value in ten years, the program will loop 10 *
periods times and accrue rate/period interest on each iteration.

## Complete TWO of the following exercises: ##

1. Write a program that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
2. Write a program that converts distances measured in kilometers to miles.
One kilometer is approximately 0.62 miles.
3. Write a program to perform a unit conversion of your own choosing. Make
sure that the program prints an introduction that explains what it does.
4. Write an interactive Python calculator program. The program should allow
the user to type a mathematical expression, and then print the value of the
expression. Include a loop so that the user can perform many calculations
(say, up to 100). Note: To quit early, the user can make the program
crash by typing a bad expression or simply closing the window that the
calculator program is running in. You'll learn better ways of terminating
interactive programs in later chapters.
