# Project #

## Complete TWO of the following exercises: ##

1. Alter the program from the last discussion question in the following ways:
(a) Make it draw squares instead of circles.
(b) Have each successive click draw an additional square on the screen
(rather than moving the existing one).
(c) Print a message on the window "Click again to quit" after the loop,
and wait for a final click before closing the window.
2. An archery target consists of a central circle of yellow surrounded by concentric
rings of red, blue, black and white. Each ring has the same width,
which is the same as the radius of the yellow circle. Write a program
that draws such a target. Hint : Objects drawn later will appear on top of
objects drawn earlier.
3. Write a program that draws some sort of face.
4. Write a program that draws a winter scene with a Christmas tree and a
snowman.
5. Write a program that draws 5 dice on the screen depicting a straight (1, 2,
3, 4, 5 or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
6. Modify the graphical future value program so that the input (principal and
APR) also are done in a graphical fashion using Entry objects.


## Complete TWO of the following exercises: ##

7. Circle Intersection.
Write a program that computes the intersection of a circle with a horizontal
line and displays the information textually and graphically.
Input: Radius of the circle and they-intercept of the line.
Output: Draw a circle centered at (0, 0) with the given radius in a window
with coordinates running from -10,-10 to 10, 1 0.
Draw a horizontal line across the window with the given y-intercept.
Draw the two points of intersection in red.
Print out the x values of the points of intersection.
Formula: x = ±√(r2 - y2)
8. Line Segment Information.
This program allows the user to draw a line segment and then displays
some graphical and textual information about the line segment.
Input: Two mouse clicks for the end points of the line segment.
Output: Draw the midpoint of the segment in cyan.
Draw the line.
Print the length and the slope of the line.
Formulas: 
dx = x2 - x1
dy = y2 - yl
slope = dy / dx
length = √(dx2 + dy2)
9. Rectangle Information.
This program displays information about a rectangle drawn by the user.
Input: Two mouse clicks for the opposite comers of a rectangle.
Output: Draw the rectangle.
Print the perimeter and area of the rectangle.
Formulas: 
area = (length) (width)
perimeter = 2(length + width)
10. Triangle Information.
Same as the previous problem, but with three clicks for the vertices of
a triangle.
Formulas: For perimeter, see length from the Line Segment problem.
area = √((s - a)(s - b)(s - c)) where a, b, and c are the lengths of
the sides and s = (a+b+c)/2
1 1. Five-click House.
You are to write a program that allows the user to draw a simple house
using five mouse clicks. The first two clicks will be the opposite corners of
the rectangular frame of the house. The third click will indicate the center
of the top edge of a rectangular door. The door should have a total width
that is 1/5 of the width of the house frame. The sides of the door should
extend from the corners of the top down to the bottom of the frame. The
fourth click will indicate the center of a square window. The window is
half as wide as the door. The last click will indicate the peak of the roof.
The edges of the roof will extend from the point at the peak to the corners
of the top edge of the house frame. (see page 128 of book for an image of the house)
