program should print the lyrics for five different animals, similar to the
example verse below.
Old MacDonald had a farm, Ee-igh, Ee-igh, Oh!
And on that farm he had a cow, Ee-igh, Ee-igh, Oh!
With a moo, moo here and a moo, moo there.
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo, moo.
Old MacDonald had a farm, Ee-igh, Ee-igh, Oh!
2. Write a program to print the lyrics for ten verses of "The Ants Go Marching.
" A couple of sample verses are given below. You may choose your own
activity for the "little one" in each verse, but be sure to choose something
that makes the rhyme work (or almost work) .
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah! hurrah!
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah! hurrah!
The ants go marching one by one,
The little one stops to suck his thumb,
And they all go marching down ...
In the ground ...
To get out ....
Of the rain.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
The ants go marching two by two, hurrah! hurrah!
The ants go marching two by two, hurrah! hurrah!
The ants go marching two by two,
The little one stops to tie his shoe,
And they all go marching down ...
In the ground ...
To get out ...
Of the rain.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
