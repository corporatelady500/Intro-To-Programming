# Project #

## Complete TWO of the following exercises: ##

1. Write a program to calculate the volume and surface area of a sphere from
its radius, given as input. Here are some formulas that might be useful:
V = 4/37rr3
A= 47rr2
2. Write a program that calculates the cost per square inch of a circular pizza,
given its diameter and price. The formula for area is A = πr2
3. Write a program that computes the molecular weight of a carbohydrate (in
grams per mole) based on the number of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen
atoms in the molecule. The program should prompt the user to enter the
number of hydrogen atoms, the number of carbon atoms, and the number
of oxygen atoms. The program then prints the total combined molecular
weight of all the atoms based on these individual atom weights:
Atom Weight
(grams I mole)
H 1.00794
c 12.0107
0 15.9994
For example, the molecular weight of water (H20) is: 2(1.00794) +
15.9994 = 18.01528.
4. Write a program that determines the distance to a lightning strike based on
the time elapsed between the flash and the sound of thunder. The speed
of sound is approximately 1100 ft/ sec and 1 mile is 5280 ft.
5. The Konditorei coffee shop sells coffee at $10.50 a pound plus the cost
of shipping. Each order ships for $0.86 per pound + $1.50 fixed cost for
overhead. Write a program that calculates the cost of an order.
6. Two points in a plane are specified using the coordinates (x1,y1) and
(x2,y2). Write a program that calculates the slope of a line through two
(non-vertical) points entered by the user.
slope= y2 - y1 x2 - x1
7. Write a program that accepts two points (see previous problem) and determines
the distance between them.
distance= .j(x2- x1)2 + (y2- y1)2

## Complete ONE of the following exercises: ##

1. Write a program to find the sum of the first n natural numbers, where the
value of n is provided by the user.
2. Write a program to find the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers
where the value of n is provided by the user.
3. Write a program to sum a series of numbers entered by the user. The
program should first prompt the user for how many numbers are to be
summed. The program should then prompt the user for each of the numbers
in turn and print out a total sum after all the numbers have been
entered. Hint: Use an input statement in the body of the loop.
4. Write a program that finds the average of a series of numbers entered by
the user. As in the previous problem, the program will first ask the user
how many numbers there are. Note: The average should always be a float,
even if the user inputs are all ints.
5. Write a program that approximates the value of pi by summing the terms
of this series: 4/1- 4/3 + 4/5- 4/7 + 4/9- 4/11 + . . . The program should
prompt the user for n, the number of terms to sum, and then output the
sum of the first n terms of this series. Have your program subtract the
approximation from the value of math. pi to see how accurate it is.

## Complete ONE of the following exercises: ##

1. As discussed in the chapter, string formatting could be used to simplify the
dateconvert2 . py program. Go back and redo this program making use
of the string-formatting method.
2. A certain CS professor gives 5-point quizzes that are graded on the scale
5-A, 4-B, 3-C, 2-D, 1-F, 0-F. Write a program that accepts a quiz score as
an input and prints out the corresponding grade.
3. A certain CS professor gives 100-point exams that are graded on the scale
90- 100:A, 80-89:B, 70-79:C, 60-69:D, <60:F. Write a program that accepts
an exam score as input and prints out the corresponding grade.

## Complete ONE of the following exercises: ##

1. An acronym is a word formed by taking the first letters of the words in a
phrase and making a word from them. For example, RAM is an acronym
for "random access memory." Write a program that allows the user to
type in a phrase and then outputs the acronym for that phrase. Note : The
acronym should be all uppercase, even if the words in the phrase are not
capitalized.
2. Numerologists claim to be able to determine a person's character traits
based on the "numeric value" of a name. The value of a name is determined
by summing up the values of the letters of the name where "a" is
1 "b" is 2 "c" is 3 up to "z" being 26 For example the name "Zelle" would have the value 26 + 5 + 12 + 12 + 5 = 60 (which happens to be a
very auspicious number, by the way). Write a program that calculates the
numeric value of a single name provided as input.
